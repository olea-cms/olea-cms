Milestone 1: Environment Setup and Initial Project Scaffolding

Tasks:

    Set up project repositories.
    Configure development environments.
    Initialize project structure for both frontend and backend.
    Set up CI pipeline with GitHub Actions.

Steps:

    Set Up Project Repositories:

Milestone 2: Backend Development Completed

Tasks:

    Implement user authentication.
    Implement content management (CRUD operations for posts and media).
    Integrate CI pipeline with automated tests.
    Integrate Honeycomb for event tracing.
    Integrate Papertrail for log management.

Steps:

    Implement User Authentication:
        Use JWT for session management.
        Hash passwords using bcrypt.

    Example Code:

    javascript

    const express = require('express');
    const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');

    const app = express();
    app.use(express.json());

    const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
        host: 'your-planetscale-host',
        user: 'your-username',
        password: 'your-password',
        database: 'your-database'
    });

    app.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
        const { username, password, email } = req.body;
        const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
        await connection.execute('INSERT INTO Users (username, password_hash, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', [username, hashedPassword, email]);
        res.sendStatus(201);
    });

    app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
        const { username, password } = req.body;
        const [rows] = await connection.execute('SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = ?', [username]);
        const user = rows[0];
        if (user && await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash)) {
            const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, 'your-secret-key');
            res.json({ token });
        } else {
            res.sendStatus(401);
        }
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
        console.log('Server running on port 3000');
    });

    Implement Content Management:
        Create endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts and media.

    Integrate CI Pipeline with Automated Tests:
        Write tests for user authentication and content management endpoints.

    Integrate Honeycomb for Event Tracing:
        Follow the previously provided instructions for setting up Honeycomb.

    Integrate Papertrail for Log Management:
        Follow the previously provided instructions for setting up Papertrail.

Milestone 3: Frontend Development Completed

Tasks:

    Develop UI for blog posts and portfolio items.
    Implement user authentication in frontend.
    Set up API integration.
    Integrate Honeycomb for event tracing.

Steps:

    Develop UI for Blog Posts and Portfolio Items:
        Use React components to create UI for displaying posts and portfolio items.

    Implement User Authentication in Frontend:
        Use JWT for managing user sessions.

    Example Code:

    javascript

    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import axios from 'axios';

    function App() {
        const [token, setToken] = useState(null);

        const login = async () => {
            const response = await axios.post('/login', { username: 'user', password: 'pass' });
            setToken(response.data.token);
        };

        return (
            <div>
                {token ? <p>Logged in</p> : <button onClick={login}>Login</button>}
            </div>
        );
    }

    export default App;

    Set Up API Integration:
        Use axios or fetch to integrate with backend APIs.

    Integrate Honeycomb for Event Tracing:
        Follow the previously provided instructions for setting up Honeycomb.

Milestone 4: Deployment and Initial Testing

Tasks:

    Deploy backend to Heroku.
    Deploy frontend to Vercel.
    Set up UptimeRobot for availability monitoring.
    Ensure CI/CD pipelines are fully functional.

Steps:

        Create a Heroku app and connect your GitHub repository.
        Set environment variables in Heroku.

    Heroku Procfile:

    plaintext

    web: node src/index.js

    Deploy Frontend to Vercel:
        Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
        Configure build settings in Vercel.

    Set Up UptimeRobot for Availability Monitoring:
        Create monitors for your website and API endpoints in UptimeRobot.

    Ensure CI/CD Pipelines are Fully Functional:
        Verify that code changes trigger the CI/CD pipelines and result in successful deployments.

Tasks:

    Conduct final testing to ensure all features work as expected.
    Write user and developer documentation.
    Launch the CMS.
    Monitor Honeycomb, UptimeRobot, and Papertrail for any necessary adjustments.

    Check if all must-have and should-have requirements are met.
    Ensure the CMS performs well under expected traffic.
    Collect user feedback to identify any usability issues.
    Review observability data to detect any performance bottlenecks or errors.

Performance Metrics:

    Page load times.
    API response times.
